# 🎧📚 AI Study Mood Detector

An AI-powered application that detects a user's **study mood** from text input and provides insights or recommendations accordingly. This project is designed as a **mini project** to demonstrate the use of **Machine Learning, NLP, and Streamlit**.


## 🚀 Project Overview

Students often struggle with focus, motivation, and stress while studying. This project analyzes user text (feelings, thoughts, or study-related input) and predicts the **mood** (e.g., Focused, Tired, Stressed, Distracted).

The application is simple, interactive, and beginner-friendly.


## 🧠 Features

* 🔍 Mood detection using **Machine Learning**
* 📝 Text-based input analysis
* 📊 NLP-based feature extraction
* 🎯 Real-time predictions
* 🌐 Interactive UI using **Streamlit**
* 🧪 Easy to train and test model


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10**
* **Scikit-learn** (ML model)
* **TF-IDF Vectorizer** (Text feature extraction)
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data handling)
* **Streamlit** (Web interface)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Lakshitha-R-E/AI-Smart-Study-Mood-Detector
cd AI Smart Study Mood Detection

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3️⃣ Train the model
python train_model.py


### 4️⃣ Run the application
streamlit run app.py


## 📌 Example Use Case

**Input:**

> "I feel tired and can't concentrate on my studies"

**Output:**

> 😟 Mood Detected: *Stressed*


## ⚠️ Common Warnings Explained

* **Pylance warning: `Import "streamlit" could not be resolved`**

  * This is a VS Code editor warning
  * Code runs fine if Streamlit is installed
  * Fix by selecting the correct Python interpreter


## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding **text classification**
* Using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
* Training and saving ML models
* Building simple ML web apps
* Debugging Python environment issues


## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Voice-based mood detection
* Recommendation system (music, breaks, tips)
* More mood categories
* Deep learning models (LSTM / BERT)
